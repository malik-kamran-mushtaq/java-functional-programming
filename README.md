# java-functional-programming
This is basic Java Functional Programming Repository.
It can usually be used before learning Spring Framwork.
It contains:
1. stream
2. filter
3. Lamda expression
4. map
5. Optional class

Note: I might add more files to this repo later on. But for now it is sufficient to get started with Spring Framework.
